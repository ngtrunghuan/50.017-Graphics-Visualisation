This Xcode project is provided for your convenience,
so that you can develop on Xcode and enjoy its beautiful interface
and autocomplete power.

But please do try to compile on VS2010.
Treat it as a learning experience to compile C++ across platforms.
Writing portable C++ is a skill used in games, math libraries, etc.

If your code does not compile on VS2010,
you may risk losing marks and delay in getting your assignment results.
We may automatically give 0 points until you appeal for us to try on a different compiler.
And you may lose marks even if we finally get it to run.

For the basic parts of the assignments,
you won't really have to do much to make your code portable.
But as you try more adventurous stuff, (e.g. Vertex Buffer Objects),
you will understand the difficulty of writing cross-platform C++.

Please do not modify anything in vecmath.
We will be using the original vecmath to test your code.

But feel free to extend upon vecmath,
as long you don't touch their .h and .cpp.

For your assignments, please don't use any external libraries found online
(e.g. eigen, gismo, cgal, qslim), as they can make some parts super trivial
(for example, eigen has functions to help you solve conjugate gradient,
which may be needed for a future extra credit)
Implementing these algorithms on your own is part of the challenge.

For your final project, do feel free to use any external libraries you want. =)
